Devise setup.

- Add TODO in config/production for Devise mailer.
- Add a Devise User model.
- Add authenticate_user! calls to Products, Categories,
and Brands controllers to ensure that non logged-in users
can only see the index and show actions.

Efficient DB Queries.

- Change Product loading from Product.all to
Product.includes(:brand, :category).all so that the associations
are loaded along with all the Products.
